# Life-Expectancy-and-GPD

We will analyse data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. 
Main purpose is to identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

1. Identify life expectancy for each country
2. How life expectancy has increased over the years (Developing and Developed countries).
3. How GPD of the countries has increased over the years (Developing and Developed Countries).
4. Trends between GPD and life expectancy (One variable is dependent on the other).

Any criticism or advice is welcome, feel free to contribute in order to improve all the analyses. 

This is the beginning of the road.

Thank you...
